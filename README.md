## Idea

- Tiled world that is constrained to geographic location
- Characters are persistent and can move between geographic locations (with inventory)
- VIM-ish keybindings
    * hjkl for movements
    * action-modifier-movement (i.e. b2k - build item 2 above me)
    * . repeats last command
- Default tiles are grass
- Character can dig to find raw materials (starts with hands, very slow)
- Resources renew randomly each night (untapped resources grow each night)
